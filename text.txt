Personal Data (PD): From Article 4 (Definitions): ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an
online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic,
cultural or social identity of that natural person; While there are many items of PD that may be obvious (a name, an
address, a phone number), others are less immediately obvious. Take for example a website where you collect logs of
activity on the site, inclusive of the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the site’s visitors. While an IP address on
its own may not appear to be PD (this would be known as an identifier, or assuming you have not internally mapped an IP
to a given user, a pseudonymised identifier), there likely exists another database, with an ISP or another website,
that relates this address to a ‘natural person’ – consequently, the storage of IP addresses does constitute storage of
PD.
